I am a recent MSc IT graduate with a strong foundation in data analysis, cybersecurity fundamentals, and software development. My technical skills include experience with Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), Tableau, and BI tools. I enjoy solving complex problems, working with data, and continuously learning new technologies.

Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity, with a strong interest in threat detection, risk management, and system security. My goal is to secure an entry-level cybersecurity or data analyst role where I can apply my analytical mindset, technical skills, and passion for technology to contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow professionally.
